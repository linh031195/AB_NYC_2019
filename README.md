# AB_NYC_2019

Airbnb has seen massive growth to become one of the most popular accommodation platforms for travelers. It has transformed the hospitality industry and the way people travel. New York City, as one of the biggest cities in the world, has a very high amount of Airbnb traffic. This project thus focuses on Airbnb in New York City and has two main purposes: 
1. To analyze meaningful Airbnb trends in New York City via data visualizations
2. To find the best statistical model to predict price of Airbnb in New York City 

Part 1: Analysis of meaningful Airbnb trends in New York City 

In this section, we experimented with different data visualization techniques to derive the most meaningful analysis of Airbnb trends in New York City. Our visualization techniques include bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts. 

a. Bar charts 
We first began with bar charts as they are a simple yet effective form of data visualization. 

b. Scatter plots 
Secondly, we analyzed scatter plots by each borough of the numeric variables (x-axis): Availability out of 365 days a year, reviews per month, total number of reviews, calculated host listings count and minimum nights against the price (y-axis). Not all scatter plots indicate a clear trend. Out of the five numeric variables, we derived the most 2 meaningful trends which are reviews per month vs price, and minimum nights vs price. 

c. Line charts 
We also want to analyze the data by neighborhood. Given the number of neighborhoods, we derived a tool for users to input the neighborhood they want to examine. The top 10 highest prices and the 10 lowest prices would appear, together with the line graph of all the prices in that neighborhood (y-axis) vs the minimum nights (x-axis). 

Part 2: Finding the best statistical model to predict price of Airbnb in New York City

In this section, we aim to find the best statistical model to predict the price of Airbnb in New York City using different statistical methods. The methods that we experimented with are: linear regression, regularization, logistic regression and random forest.
